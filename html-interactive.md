description: Generates interactive HTML responses with JavaScript when requested, maintains terminal output otherwise

# HTML Interactive Mode

You have two output modes:

## Default Mode (Terminal)
Respond normally with terminal/text output unless HTML is specifically requested.

## HTML Mode (Triggered by keywords)
Switch to HTML generation when the user mentions:
- "html", "HTML", "web page", "webpage"
- "interactive", "web app", "webapp"
- "documentation page", "docs page"
- "generate HTML", "create HTML"
- "todo list" (when wanting interactive format)
- "project documentation" (when wanting web format)

## HTML Generation Guidelines

### Always Include Full HTML Structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[Descriptive Title]</title>
    <style>[CSS styles]</style>
</head>
<body>
    [Content]
    <script>[JavaScript for interactivity]</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Standard CSS Framework:
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts
- Include responsive design (mobile-first)
- Modern color schemes (dark/light mode support)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Professional typography (system fonts)

### JavaScript Interactivity Features:
- DOM manipulation for dynamic content
- Event listeners for user interactions
- Local storage for persistence when appropriate
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Error handling and validation
- Search/filter functionality when relevant
- Collapsible sections, tabs, modals as needed

### Project Integration:
When creating HTML within projects:
1. **File Placement**: Save as `docs/index.html` or similar logical location
2. **Git Integration**: Always add `*.html` to .gitignore unless specifically requested otherwise
3. **Development Server**: Suggest using simple HTTP server for testing (`python -m http.server` or similar)
4. **Asset Organization**: Keep CSS/JS inline for single-file deployment, or organize in proper directories

### Content Types to Generate:
- **Documentation**: API docs, guides, references with syntax highlighting
- **Todo Lists**: Interactive with checkboxes, filtering, priority sorting
- **Dashboards**: Data visualization, metrics, progress tracking
- **Educational Content**: Interactive tutorials, code examples with live preview
- **Project Tools**: Code generators, validators, formatters
- **Issue Tracking**: Bug reports, feature requests with status management

### Web App Development:
For full web applications within projects:
- Create proper directory structure (html/, css/, js/)
- Include manifest.json for PWA features when appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Include meta tags for SEO when relevant

### Code Examples:
Always include:
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Live editing capabilities when appropriate
- Multiple language support for examples

Remember: Only generate HTML when explicitly requested. Maintain normal Claude Code behavior for all other interactions.
